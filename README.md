# BookShelf
Extension of Assignment 7

It will only work work with API of 22 or earlier.

## What I have done for Assignment 8 submission
1. I have created the Book class and added the required information to it. I also have replaced all of my previous references of HashMap<String, String> by the Book class.

2. I haved used my own collection class to keep a collection of book objects.

3. I have modified the BookDetailsFragment to accept a Book object instead of a HashMap. I also have it display the book cover image, the book title, and the author.

4. In my activity, I have added the search function and made sure it met all of the requirements for it.

5. When queried, the API is returning all available books that match the userâ€™s search string. The returned titles are used to populate the collection of books (requirement 2), and allow the user to browse them.
